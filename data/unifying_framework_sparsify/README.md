# unifying_framework_sparsify

This directory contains the uncertainty data for the unifying framework algorithm, sparsification mode.

+ __rec_100__ - dataset name
  + __rec_100_[reduction ratio]__
    + __individual_instances__ - since there is no closed form solution for this algorithm, I ran the program 100 times to compute the uncertainty data
    + sparsified_uncertainty_graph_[reduction ratio] - the original graph with the uncertainty information on the edges
+ __celegans_453__
  + (same as __rec_100__)
+ __lesmis_77__
  + (same as __rec_100__)
